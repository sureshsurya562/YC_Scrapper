Hear from the founders
How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)

Our founders Daniel Yanisee and Jonathan Perichon were working as engineers at on-demand delivery startup Deliv and saw firsthand that the background check industry was antiquated. As the on-demand economy was exploding, the background check process was stuck in time‚Äîtedious and slow. It was slowing down the hiring process on both sides, especially among companies with a fast moving, flexible workforce like the gig economy.At heart, they are engineers. They see a problem, and they want to fix it. They knew they could streamline the background check process to put people to work quickly without sacrificing accuracy. This led to the creation of Checkr, an API-first technology platform that combines the best in human expertise and AI to simplify disjointed, labor-intensive hiring processes. Our mission really solidified over their first interactions with job applicants. They heard firsthand the hardships of finding a job‚Äîand putting food on the table. They saw applicants get rejected because of something in the past, which in no way impacted their ability to do the jobs they were applying for today. They saw an opportunity to be a positive force in the job market ‚Äì to focus on eliminating bias and championing a fairer future.

How did you decide to apply to Y Combinator? What was your experience applying, going through the batch, and fundraising at demo day?

Daniel held high regard for Y Combinator, even back during his time living in Europe. He considered Y Combinator an ideal platform for transitioning from an engineer to a founder - a vision he shared with Checkr co-founder, Jonathan Perichon. Captivated by their experience at several Y Combinator events, they applied and were accepted into the program.Their time at Y Combinator was transformative, and they consider themselves YC superfans. One memorable experience was what Daniel likes to call 'speed dating' with investors during a demo day held at the Computer History Museum. Before this, Daniel's understanding of the venture capital landscape was somewhat limited. His YC experience gave him essential knowledge and investor exposure that has proven instrumental in Checkr's growth.

Hear from the founders
How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)

I grew up working at my dad‚Äôs tire shop, which taught me the ins and outs of operating a small business. Fast forward to college, and I was generating $80K in revenue from running an iPad accessory business on Shopify, a software platform for e-commerce. I started to ask myself why my dorm-room side hustle had access to 10x better technology than my dad‚Äôs tire shop, a much more complex operation that did $3.5M in gross revenue. This realization‚Äîthat no one was building software for brick-and-mortar local businesses‚Äîultimately led Dennis and me to start Podium. Along the way, many investors told us to focus on Enterprise, given the price sensitivity and volatility of the SMB customer segment. While we were tempted to pivot when we got to Y-Combinator, our unwavering belief in small businesses and dedication to helping them grow became the core of Podium‚Äôs success. We believe the greatest opportunities for impact are often found in underserved, unglamorous markets that most people overlook.

How did you decide to apply to Y Combinator? What was your experience applying, going through the batch, and fundraising at demo day?

When starting Podium, we read every single essay from Paul Graham and used them as the blueprint for building Podium in the early days. It was a dream of ours to get into YC one day.¬†Even though we started the business in 2014, we didn‚Äôt apply until the winter 2016 batch because we initially thought that our SMB reviews product wasn‚Äôt a big enough idea for YC. We were amazed and excited when we were accepted into the W16 batch.¬†During the batch, we grew from $1M to $3.5M ARR. At one point, we considered pivoting the product in a more trendy direction, but Dalton and Aaron (our group partners) told us that we were insane since we had a product people wanted and were buying like crazy. Staying the course turned out to be excellent advice. Due to our explosive revenue growth, we had a lot of investor interest on demo day. However, we had enough capital so we decided to wait until the end of the year to raise. We ended up raising our Series A in early 2017 at a $100M valuation from investors we had met on demo day. Being a company based outside of the Bay Area, Y Combinator was invaluable to us since it gave us the support and exposure to top-tier investors we needed to continue building Podium into a world-changing company.

‚õµÔ∏è Truewind: AI-powered Accounting
See original launch post

Truewind is designed for accountants

Truewind is helping accounting firms increase the profits of their CAS practice. The solution that has helped over a hundred companies with their month-end close is now available for accounting firms and internal accounting teams.

Introducing the next-generation AI-powered accounting solution

How does an ‚ÄúAI-powered‚Äù accounting solution improve your current operations?

With the power of LLMs, you are able to:

Auto-classify bank and credit card transactions with >90% accuracy
Identify accrual entries and auto-create a work paper in 1-click
Collect supporting documentation automatically with 0 intervention
Match supporting documentation to your accounting journal entries

Think of Truewind as a digital accountant. A digital accountant that does the repetitive work of categorizing transactions, finding supporting documentation, and closing the month-end books. A digital accountant that works while you sleep.

Most alternatives are service providers that are prone to manual errors and overhead costs

There are many vendors that help startups with bookkeeping and accounting. These service companies are easy to start because, in the background, they have an army of operational staff who manually enter your data into an accounting system.

If the transaction is missing an invoice or receipt, they will manually follow up with you for that document. Accrual journal entries are manually tracked in an Excel sheet and manually updated monthly. Lastly, reports are manually downloaded and shipped to you for review.

Why is this problematic? The manual-intensive process is an error-prone one. The Excel file below is an example of how they manage this; now multiply this by 100 rows and 20 tabs. Maybe they get it right as high as 99% of the time. But inevitably, with humans manually going back and forth between Excel tabs and traditional legacy systems, it‚Äôs never going to be 100%.

Month-End Close Powered by AI

Truewind helps accountants close their books faster without the administrative overhead costs that come with most month-end close management solutions.

Traditional month-end close solutions‚Äô is a checklist. Accountants dislike these solutions because they add administrative workload. Accountants track their month-end checklist in Excel or Google Sheets because it works, but because their company decided to purchase a month-end close software, they have to manually move their checklist into the software each month.

Truewind is different in that we actually do the work for you. Truewind is a digital accountant that does the journal entry work while you rest. Each day, you get into the office with your morning queue of work prepared for you to review.

Here are just a few examples:

The AI model is trained on your client‚Äôs historical data so that bank and credit card transactions can be auto-classified to the correct account, payee, and department
By studying historical patterns, Truewind identifies prepaid expenses and auto-capitalizes the transaction as an asset. Each month, we auto-update the work paper and write the journal entry
By studying historical patterns, Truewind identifies and recognizes an accrued expense even though an invoice or payment is missing; when it arrives next month, we auto-adjust the journal entries
Rather than manually searching for supporting documentation, our integrated AI agents auto-identify the supporting documentation that is tied to each journal entry and transaction
Visit us at AICPA Engage 24 - Silver Sponsors

In addition to this product launch, I‚Äôm excited to announce that Truewind is a Silver Sponsor of the AICPA CIMA Engage 24 Conference üíé

AICPA & CIMA Engage is the largest gathering of accountants and finance professionals in North America, with close to 4,000 attendees. And we are thrilled to be a Silver Sponsor for this event. In the coming weeks, we will post about how Truewind helps accounting firms and internal accounting teams close the books closer and get their life back.

We have many fun activities and talks planned. Follow us on LinkedIn & Twitter to stay tuned for more.

How to learn more and sign up

All of these capabilities are available today for our early accounting firm partners and will be available broadly on June 1, 2024. Our accounting firm partners include fast-growing boutique firms and top 50 national firms.

We have room for 2-3 more accounting firms in our May onboarding batch. Then, in early June, we will be showcasing this and more at the Engage 24 conference.

If you‚Äôd like to see a live demo and potentially sign up:

Unfortunately, Mochi üê∂ didn‚Äôt make this photo. During our Launch YC a year ago, Truewind was a team of three. Today, we‚Äôre 15 strong with over a hundred customers, including multiple top 50 accounting firms. From our team to everyone - Thank you to the many startups and accounting firms we get to work with day in and day out. We look forward to meeting many more of you.

Company Launches
Synaptiq üß† AI-Powered Training for Doctors
See original launch post

Hi, we‚Äôre Ryan, Jake, and Kevin, the team behind Synaptiq.

TLDR

Synaptiq began as a tool Ryan created during his studies at UCSF Medical School which helped him score in the 100th percentile on the Step 1 licensing exam and get accepted into Stanford‚Äôs neurosurgery residency.

Ryan then teamed up with Jake and Kevin, his two best childhood friends and accomplished engineers, to expand Synaptiq into an AI-powered medical training platform that boosts learning speed and memory retention 7X.

Synaptiq is now used in over 220 medical schools and hospitals, in 85 countries, and is growing at 110% month/month. Synaptiq plans to become the AI infrastructure for the $110B medical education industry, leading to better physicians, a more efficient healthcare system, and improved patient care.

THE PROBLEM

Medical training hasn‚Äôt significantly advanced in 250 years ‚Äì trainees are still taught with archaic, static tools like textbooks. As a result, doctors forget over 50% of all new knowledge within 8 months, which leads to immeasurable patient harm and costs billions of dollars in burnout-related physician turnover.

THE SOLUTION

Synaptiq trains doctors with AI, helping them learn faster and retain 7x more information than any alternative.

It began as a tool Ryan created for his own medical studies at UCSF, propelling him into the 100th percentile on the Step 1 licensing exam and leading him to be accepted into Stanford‚Äôs neurosurgery program, the most selective residency in the country.

Seeing the impact this would have if applied to all of healthcare, he dropped out of residency to go full-time on Synaptiq. He teamed up with his best friends of over 20 years, Jake and Kevin, to design and build the platform.

Since launching, Synaptiq has rapidly spread to over 220 medical schools and hospitals across 85 countries and is growing at 110% month/month ‚Äì underscoring the significant unmet need.

HOW IT WORKS

Synaptiq uses AI and neuroscience-based algorithms to personalize the learning experience of every user. By predicting when each user will forget each topic, the material is always reinforced at the optimal time, enabling doctors to retain their knowledge indefinitely. AI also enables an unprecedented level of premium content production, eliminating the moat that traditional publishers have long held.

Synaptiq plans to become the AI infrastructure for the $110B medical education industry, leading to better physicians, a more efficient healthcare system, and improved patient care.

HOW YOU CAN HELP

We are on a mission to transform medical training for the better. Here‚Äôs what you can do to help üôè

Company Launches
StarSling - AI Portal for Developers That Ship üõ∏
See original launch post

Hey everyone!

We‚Äôre Yonas & Daniel - Co-founders of StarSling.

StarSling (https://starsling.dev) is a developer portal that turns your daily unplanned work from all your dev tools into one-click actions, powered by AI. Open your homepage, click on a GitHub, Linear, or Sentry issue and you‚Äôll see an Autofix button that triggers an agent and opens a Pull Request with a fix, all without leaving your portal. It‚Äôs AI agents for the tasks that live outside of your code editor, across deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs.

https://youtu.be/-rbrSNyguHY¬†

üåÑ Our Story

Daniel led an engineering team at Netflix that built their Internal Developer Portal (IDP), called Netflix Console. It was the central hub for Netflix's 3,000+ engineers, managers and leaders and became the highest DAU internal tool for developers at Netflix.

Yonas built StackShare, one of the largest online developer communities that had over 1.5M registered developers and an enterprise offering used by thousands of companies that integrated tech stack data into their IDPs and other internal tools.

Both of us have seen the challenges that developers at large companies face in keeping their tech stacks healthy across thousands of codebases. We‚Äôve also seen the benefits that a high-quality single IDP brings to engineering teams. We believe that AI agents have created a unique opportunity for developers to get the benefits of an IDP with automation baked in from the start.

üî• The Problem

Developers typically spend ~20% of their time on annoying eng tasks outside of their code editor:

Fixing exceptions
Patching flaky CI builds and tests
Updating engineering docs and changelogs
Investigating and remediating incidents
Optimizing slow database queries
Debugging preview and staging environments
Rotating expiring credentials and keys

These tasks are spread out across many different developer tools and workflows: Sentry, GitHub, CircleCI, PagerDuty, Supabase, Vercel and many more. StarSling is unifying these tools and bringing AI agents to the rest of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
üßØ Our Solution

We're building a system of AI agents that perform engineering tasks using the deep context that only exists in an internal developer portal (IDP). One central command center that houses internal services, applications, APIs, documentation and has AI agents continuously improving them. We bring your tools into one system and give you powerful workflows by orchestrating AI agents across these tools.

Our first offering is an agentic developer homepage that shows you your aggregated task list along with actions that AIs can take on your behalf. In your homepage you‚Äôll see: your open PRs, exceptions, tickets, notifications, and more alongside AI agents.

Soon StarSling will orchestrate agents across the more complex tasks like investigating incidents. Our immediate goal is to be the interface and ‚Äúportal‚Äù to all the AI agents for the dev tools you already use.

üîÆ Our Vision

To create a system of AI agents that allows every engineer to spend close to 0% of their time dealing with deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs.

üëá Our Ask

If you‚Äôre a developer working on a production system, we‚Äôd love to show you StarSling and get your feedback!

Hear from the founders
What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

The problem is two-fold. From a student‚Äôs perspective: The studying process is fragmented, leading to sub-optimal and expensive learning experiences. Students have to use multiple learning apps - note-taking, flashcards, quizzes, AI help, tutoring, and reminder apps - to have a complete learning experience. From speaking to numerous students (and being former students ourselves), there is a significant opportunity to use AI to make studying a truly seamless end-to-end experience that understands the student deeply. From an educational institution‚Äôs perspective: The AI genie is out of the bottle, and existing institutions realize this and are deeply concerned about how to embrace AI and deliver the value it promises to their students in a safe and impactful manner without compromising the goal of education delivery. This is what Shepherd provides. Imagine a world with 19M college students (to start with) getting an institution-endorsed AI-enabled learning assistant in their pocket. Students get education-specific workflows, not just chatbots, access to tutors, and a learning community. Institutions get analytics, control on prompting, and the ability to monitor academic dishonesty. This is the future of education.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

Every learner has Shepherd in their pocket. This means they have a personalized learning assistant designed specifically for them to enable them to excel at any subject they choose.

Domu ü§ñ - Increasing sales & debt collection for financial services and insurance companies
See original launch post

Tl;dr: Domu uses generative AI to automate debt collection and sales calls for financial services. We work with 8 of the 20 largest banks and insurance companies across the Americas, such as MetLife, Skandia, BBVA, and BNP Paribas Cardif.

‚Äî

Hi everyone, we are Nico and Camila. We‚Äôve been friends for quite a while, we met 3 years ago while Cami was finishing her MBA at HEC Paris and Nico was finishing his research at CMU, after that, we participated in more than 10 hackathons together, and made 450 sales calls to understand the biggest problems in banking and communications, we realized collections was a real issue. So we decided to start Domu.

At Domu, we‚Äôve built probably one of the biggest female teams in the current YC batch, and every day, we wake up with the conviction of helping our clients automate sales calls for collections and insurance sales.

Our founding team would not be possible without the contributions of Margarita G√≥mez, our CTO, and Isabela Rodr√≠guez, our CGO. As CGO, I have been able to drive the company‚Äôs growth by 290% month over month, establishing new partnerships and showcasing our product. Margarita, as CTO, has made our voicebot more efficient, optimizing the automation process for our clients.

üö® The Problem: Inefficient and costly customer interactions

Very few people in the world like to make calls to charge people money.

Enterprises struggle with all the back-office tasks to manage call centers or debt collection agencies due to the volume of clients. Manual processes lead to high operational costs and a lack of scalability.

Take our client, a major insurance company, as an example. They manually contact more than 150,000 customers monthly, which is around 500,000 minutes spent on callsüò±. This process also involves capturing data, pulling that data, and analyzing it, which usually results in suboptimal outcomes.

ü´°¬†The Solution: Automated and personalized communications at scale Domu automates customer interactions using GenAI, reducing the need for extensive operational teams. We automate calls and integrate with channels like SMS, WhatsApp, and emails, and give our customers real-time data to track metrics.

üíú¬† By using Domu, companies can:

Significantly reduce operational costs.
Improve debt collection and conversion rates.
Gain real-time insights about their clients to improve communication.

üëáüèº Click here to check our first DEMO

üìà Opportunity: The immense potential of our market

For every large enterprise with thousands of clients, millions are spent on inefficient communication processes and sales agents. By automating these interactions, Domu can save companies substantial amounts and improve their customer relationships.

In the US alone, the potential savings in the debt collection sector are enormous, with trillions of dollars at stake. Domu's AI-powered solutions provide a significant opportunity for enterprises to enhance their communication efficiency and effectiveness.

üìù Ask: How you can help

üö®Free food alert üö®: We keep growing and growing ‚Äî Please name the best insurance companies or banks you know in the US that work with personal credit/policy lines. If you know a VP of Sales, Collections, or someone in the C-suite, we will buy breakfast for you ü•ûü§§.
Mentor / Experts: We are looking to get advisors in the industry. If you know any potential experts who work or have worked at banks, credit unions, or insurance companies in the US, we would love to talk to them.

Hear from the founders
How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)

Troy and Jake met in at Grove City College outside of Pittsburgh. They lived in the same dorm, played sports together and enjoyed frequent conversations about the world. After initially bootstrapping Gecko, Jake and Troy reconnected and saw the same vision of building a robotics company to solve real challenges in the built world.

How did you decide to apply to Y Combinator? What was your experience applying, going through the batch, and fundraising at demo day?

Jake was unfamiliar with YC before they applied. In the fall of 2016, Troy learned that Kevin Hale was scheduled to be in Pittsburgh promoting the next cohort. Jake and Troy met him and talked through the vision for how Gecko could scale. At the time Gecko was making money but wasn‚Äôt yet focused on raising money or the traction it would take to turn the company into a scalable business. Kevin, Jake and Troy talked through that path and Jake and Troy turned in their application almost immediately afterwards. Going through the batch was formative for helping Jake and Troy chart Gecko‚Äôs path forward. As the batch was starting they were weighing an acquisition offer but, thanks in large part to the advice they were getting at YC, they decided to reject the offer and build the company together.

How have you kept in touch with the YC community and continued to use YC resources & programs since the batch ended?

Yes. Mostly through interactions with Kevin Hale, Jared Friedman, Sam Altman and Jon Levy.

What's the history of your company from getting started until the present day? What were the big inflection points?

Jake built the world‚Äôs first wall-climbing ultrasonic testing robot in 2012. Soon after we were making money but weren‚Äôt sure on the path to scale. Going though YC was a key inflection point that lead us to our model for scaling Gecko. The decision to turn down early acquisition attempts and investments in favor of building the company we wanted build to was another key inflection point. Gecko turned down offers right before demo day from investors in favor of walking. Fast forward to today and Gecko is closing deals with some of the biggest energy providers on the planet as well as global institutions like the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy.

What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

Jake visited a power plant while in college. The owner talked about how assets at the plant just fail and the plant shuts down regularly and that was seen as just the cost of doing business. That seemed wrong to Jake. It made him think about the importance of the built world and how much we rely on physical assets to provide power, water, safety and other critical services. Yet at the same time they are aging and starting to breakdown - Jake thought he had found a problem hiding in plain sight. Jake and Troy talked a lot about that in the early days of Gecko and committed the company on a path to deploy advanced robotics to solve this critical problem that no one else seemed to be working on.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

The long-term vision for Gecko Robotics is to transform the world‚Äôs most important industries that have been left behind in the digitalization movement. Gecko aims to be one of the first truly impactful robotics companies and prove that the best way to build incredible hardware and software is around solving real world problems and creating impactful outcomes for customers.

Deasie - Data governance for language model applications
See original launch post

tl;dr: Deasie ensures that only relevant, high-quality, and safe data is fed into language models.

Hi! We‚Äôre¬†Reece, Leo, and Mikko and we‚Äôre excited to launch Deasie.

‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Problem

For the first time, companies are turning towards their masses of unstructured data (e.g., documents, reports, emails) for a range of Generative AI use cases. Today, most companies are unable to answer the critical questions needed to ensure language models are trained and deployed reliably: Does this data contain sensitive information? Is this the most relevant data for this problem? Are there inconsistencies in the data that could skew my results?

üí°¬†Solution

Deasie is a platform that provides automated checks for compliance (e.g., PII & proprietary data) and quality (e.g., irrelevant, untimely, or inconsistent information) of unstructured data, to reliably govern which data is used for which language model use case.

üë®‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ The Team

Founders Leo, Mikko & Reece previously built McKinsey's award-winning product that used AI to enhance data quality in the enterprise, built ML applications across QuantumBlack, MIT, Amazon, and Mercedes, and have now set out to unlock the power of unstructured data for the upcoming wave on language model applications.

üëã¬†Ask

Lots of companies must be delving into the world of LLMs. If you‚Äôve encountered challenges identifying and using high-quality input data (e.g., data that is relevant, timely, accurate, and consistent), then we‚Äôd love to hear from you! Please reach out to us at leonard@deasie.com

üß† Sohar Health: AI-powered eligibility checks, VoBs and insurance discovery for behavioral health
See original launch post

‚ö°TL;DR

Behavioral health providers are investing significant resources into expensive manual operations teams to determine if patients are eligible for care, in-network, based on their payer contracts, and determine the patient‚Äôs responsibility towards their healthcare reimbursement. Enter Sohar Health. Our API-based platform streamlines insurance eligibility verification and offers AI-powered Verification of Benefits (VoB) and insurance discovery, automating manual workflows, increasing patient intake, and generating more revenue. Experience the power of seamless integration and unleash the full potential of your behavioral health company with Sohar Health.

ü§Ø THE PROBLEM

Improving front end RCM (revenue cycle management) accuracy is crucial as 85% of related-denied claims (worth $40 billion) are preventable. However, determining the eligibility, network status, and pricing transparency for patients is a challenge due to complex relationships between payers and the limited data exchange standards in healthcare IT ecosystem. These exchanges are costly, time-consuming, and divert engineering resources, hindering product development. Delaying or skipping integrations leads to revenue loss and increased manual efforts for RCM operations teams, creating a significant barrier for behavioral health companies in a rapidly growing industry, valued at $280 billion in 2020.

üß† THE SOLUTION

Similar to Stripe (YC09) and Plaid, Sohar Health empowers developers by providing direct integrations to payers. Our API-based platform offers three key features: targeted insurance eligibility determination, accurate network status, and AI-powered Verification of Benefits (VoB). By leveraging our services, behavioral health providers can:

Unlock up to 25% additional revenue through improved front end RCM accuracy
Find more eligible patient and minimize churn or attrition
Halve the time spent on manual operations by intake or RCM teams
üëã OUR BACKSTORY

At Pelago (formerly, Quit Genius W18), the leading digital clinic for substance addictions, Ash and Lucas joined forces. Ash is an MD, with a background in digital health, hospital administration, and Health IT strategy consulting. As CTO and employee one at Pelago, Lucas possesses unparalleled expertise in resolving behavioral health integration challenges. With a track record of successfully integrating with 100+ employers, including major players like Evernorth and a Fortune 10 customer, Lucas's firsthand experience and Y Combinator background have been instrumental in securing over $80M in investment funding from seed to Series-B.

MEET THE BRAIN & THE HEART OF SOHAR HEALTHSohar Health is the marriage of an engineer‚Äôs problem-solving brain and a physician‚Äôs healing heart, connecting healthcare providers & payers in a more integrated and centralized way.LUCAS GORDONEx-CTO & CISO of Quit Genius (YC W18)Most recently CTO of Quit Genius, the world‚Äôs leading digital clinic for substance addictions, Lucas is uniquely positioned to solve benefits integration problems using all he‚Äôs learned along his career journey. He‚Äôs one of a handful of people in this market who‚Äôs experienced firsthand the pain caused by this problem, and the value of solving it.¬†Lucas holds an MSc in Computer Science from the University of London. He‚Äôs designed and built systems to integrate with 100+ employers, including integrations with Evernorth and a Fortune 10 customer. At Quit Genius, he also assumed the role of Chief Information Security Officer, leading the company through SOC-2 compliance audits, achieving HITRUST certification, and attended the Y Combinator program in 2018‚Äìhelping secure over $80M investment funding from seed to Series-B. It was there he met his co-founder, and their aligned passion for healthcare and technology, combined with their deep knowledge of inherent pain points, sparked the idea that became Sohar Health.DR. ASHISH (ASH) MANDAVIAMedical Doctor & Digital Health InnovatorA former National Healthcare System doctor in the UK, Ash was inspired to jump into the world of startups seven years ago, initially as a product manager, using his clinical knowledge to support a team of engineers to create and build a piece of triage software for ERs in the UK. He moved on to a medical education technology company as employee one and helped scale the organization as product and services director. There, he found a love for the commercial side and moved into business development.This led Ash to taking on the role as EMEA Commercial Director of Quit Genius (YC W18), where he led a team to deliver commercial B2B sales, client success, and partnerships with large employers, private healthcare insurers, and public health systems. It was there he discovered inherent pain points related to integrating with these types of payers, slowing access for people getting the help they need.Most recently, Ash was a strategic consultant¬† at Simon Kucher and Partners, focusing on market access and reimbursement for Digital Health solutions across the UK, Europe, and the US.

How did you decide to apply to Y Combinator? What was your experience applying, going through the batch, and fundraising at demo day?

The ethos and ambition towards growth and becoming a $1b+ company at Quit Genius was a strong motivator to take Sohar Health through the YC accelerator program. The company has accelerated by 12 months in a 10 week period and this is mainly due to the strong guidance from our group partners and accountability that we have shown to our peers and colleagues. We have developed significant traction among customers and our product is loved by our customers. YC has pushed us to become the most accurate eligibility verification tool in the behavioral health market and we now run upwards of 60,000 eligibility checks per month. The fundraising process has moved faster than our initial expectations and we feel that the feedback and support given prior to the raise has allowed us to enter those conversations with more confidence and purpose.

How have you kept in touch with the YC community and continued to use YC resources & programs since the batch ended?

From in-person events across the bay area to the founder matching program, we have managed to embed ourselves in the YC community and learn from this amazing network of founders. As we complete our Seed round, we hope to follow the guidance laid out in the post-batch manual and Series A fundraising guide to continue our growth trajectory and our journey towards becoming a unicorn in the health tech space.

What's the history of your company from getting started until the present day? What were the big inflection points?

Lucas and I caught up at the start of 2023 when he had exited Quit Genius (YC W18) and I was on paternity leave from my strategy consulting role. We had discussed this burning platform issue on several occasion and recognized that we were in a unique position to solve it. We initially focused on employer eligibility verification for digital health companies, but quickly became aware, through customer discovery, of an even greater challenge to tackle in Real Time Eligibility (RTE) and Coverage of Benefits (COB) determination in the behavioral health space. This was an inflection point and gave us the confidence to pursue a pre-seed round, led by Concept Ventures and allowed us to build our eligibility verification tool and automated AI coding feature. We gained further proof points of the value of our product with strong initial customer traction, booking $118K ARR in the past two months.

What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

One of the biggest reasons behavioral health companies can‚Äôt grow faster is that 11% of every patient get denied for insurance reimbursement which directly hits revenue, employee cost and marketing cost. A large proportion of these claims denials are related to eligibility inaccuracies. With our 99% accurate eligibility checker, we reduce these denials to 2%.To determine a patient‚Äôs eligibility for a behavioral health service, you could use an existing electronic checker or amass a manual administrative team. Standard automated eligibility checks in the market can only achieve a 50 - 60% accuracy level for mental and behavioral health. The reason these vendors don‚Äôt work is that they do not take account of payer carve outs - when insurance companies carve out behavioral health coverage to third party insurers.With our deep understanding of the complex integrations within the payer ecosystem, we can get our automated accuracy check up to 99% and essentially significantly reduce the chance that a patient‚Äôs claim will be denied by their insurer.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

We believe in patients accessing healthcare without limits.What if providers were free from the barriers & burdens that waste money and time, and instead could focus on the things that help patients regain and maintain their health? What if signing up for appointments with service providers were easier to manage and integrate? What if there was an easy, cost-effective way to simplify providers‚Äô operations? What if providers had more time to deliver excellent care and weren‚Äôt focusing on how to work with insurers? Sohar Health is the marriage of an engineer‚Äôs problem-solving brain and a physician‚Äôs healing heart, connecting healthcare providers & payers in a more integrated and centralized way.\We‚Äôve felt the devastating effects of ineffective healthcare on a very personal level, and we have a focused vision of getting better care to more people, quickly and seamlessly.¬†What if clinical services, delivered in bricks and mortar practices or remotely, were able to be the lifeline of hope they were intended to be for millions of patients across the US?¬†Smoother integration.Fewer barriers.Less waste.Improved health.Greater productivity.Effortless connection between payers & providers.What if?It‚Äôs time to fully connect and integrate via Sohar‚Äôs clearing house for the modern healthcare system

Rove: Travel the world for free
See original launch post

TLDR: Rove Miles is the first universal airline mile program. Earn up to 25x miles on everyday spend, hotel stays, flights, and through partner programs‚Äîall on top of your existing credit card rewards. Then, redeem those miles effortlessly across 12 global loyalty programs, 140+ airlines, and 200,000+ hotels at up to 90% off.

https://youtu.be/LsYKowedGn4

Hey everyone! We're Max and Arhan, founders of Rove, and we're excited to launch the first universal travel loyalty program that works across almost every airline and hotel in the world.

Before Rove, we founded startups at Wharton and Harvard‚Äîconnecting people through specialized Bluetooth software and revolutionizing edtech recruiting. Between scaling businesses and attending class, we traveled to over 50 countries for free in business and first class, leveraging credit card points and loyalty transfers. But our friends? They were stuck on the sidelines, locked out by complicated rules, outdated credit requirements, and high fees.

Arhan and Max

THE PROBLEM: GAPS IN ACCESSIBILITY AND USABILITY

Travel rewards today exclude millions, especially young people. Over 70 million Americans can't access premium travel credit cards, leaving a majority of Gen Z‚Äîthe generation most eager to travel‚Äîunable to earn a meaningful number of miles and points across airline and hotel loyalty programs, which provide discounts of up to 90% compared to standard credit card travel portals. Unlike markets like Hong Kong and Singapore, where earning miles is easy and part of everyday life, Americans face unnecessary complexity and high barriers.

OUR SOLUTION: ROVE MILES

Rove Miles makes travel accessible and rewarding for everyone. We've unified 12 major international loyalty programs into a single, universal currency that's easy to earn (always on top of your existing credit card rewards) and simple to redeem:

Earn miles on over 7,000 merchants by activating the Rove Shopping chrome extension before your purchase.
Earn up to 25x miles on hotel bookings made through Rove, which can be earned instantly for non-refundable stays to cover your flight there or add extra free nights.
Earn 3x bonus miles on flights on top of the miles you get from the airline when booking through Rove.

Soon, you'll also earn Rove Miles from dining, in-store purchases, and transferring existing points in from partner programs.

ROVE‚ÄôS TRANSFER PARTNERS

Rove‚Äôs initial loyalty program partners are:

Air France-KLM Flying Blue
Air India Maharaja Club
Accor Live Limitless
Aeromexico Rewards
Cathay Pacific Asia Miles
Etihad Guest
Finnair Plus
Hainan Airlines Fortune Wings Club
Vietnam Airlines Lotusmiles
Qatar Airways Privilege Club
Thai Airways Royal Orchid Plus
Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles

More programs are coming soon, with our current partnerships covering all three major airline alliances. With Rove Miles, your points become 2-3x more valuable compared to traditional credit card redemptions, even on hotels where high-value redemptions can be even harder to find. Soon, you will be able to use miles on unique travel experiences, such as events, festivals, private jet charters, or flying in zero gravity!

JOIN US ON THIS JOURNEY

We're building Rove Miles to make free annual vacations accessible to everyone, effortlessly. Stop missing out‚Äîturn your everyday spend into unforgettable travel experiences.

Stay tuned,

Max and Arhan

Diligent - GenAI assistant for fintech risk and compliance operations
See original launch post
TL;DR

Diligent¬†helps fintech risk and AML compliance teams automate and strengthen customer due diligence with Generative AI.

Fintechs and banks use us to automate tasks like running thorough due diligence on a legal entity, reviewing customer documents (e.g. certificates of incorporation, proofs of address etc) and remediating false positive alerts from AML systems.

If you‚Äôre a fintech or bank‚Ä¶ get in touch at founders@godiligent.ai.

THE PROBLEM:

Fraud and Anti Money Laundering (AML) controls¬†are key parts of the fintech and banking industry but generate significant back office workload. It's 2024 and¬†most of the work still involves human analysts running repetitive tasks¬†which are costly, error prone and take time away from real investigations that can move the needle for fincrime prevention and require expertise.

These manual tasks can include things like‚Ä¶

checking online presence to verify the legitimacy and nature of business of a customer
reviewing documents like registry extracts, proofs of address and bank statements to comply with onboarding requirements
sitting through thousands of false positive alerts from AML systems
THE SOLUTION:

Diligent builds¬†AI assistants designed to automate routine tasks, slashing cost-to-comply, strengthening risk detection and freeing up capacity for investigations that require human expertise and decision making.

Our AI assistants follow your workflow policies, integrate with existing systems and output risk intelligence or reports with a clear audit trail.

We built 3 AI assistant archetypes

‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Risk assistant:¬†Investigates holistically the risk and nature of business of customers and transaction counterparties. E.g. is the legal information declared verified? what does this company actually do? do website and address look suspicious? what's the online reputation on socials, reviews etc?
üîç¬†Screening assistant:¬†Investigates automatically alerts from screening systems and slashes time spent remediating false positives on Sanctions/PEP/Adverse Media
üìù¬†KYB assistant:¬†Verifies business information and instantly validates customer uploaded documents (register extract, proof of address, bank statements etc.) according to custom acceptance policy to remove back-office verification work and avoid customer friction

Here is a quick demo on how they can work together to conduct due diligence on a legal entity by investigating its legitimacy online, checking documentation, and reviewing alerts for Sanctions/PEP/Adverse Media against it.

THE TEAM:

We‚Äôre¬†Edo¬†and¬†Ahmed.

Ahmed led multiple teams as VP engineering at Billie (Europe‚Äôs largest B2B BNPL) across business identification, fraud, credit and aml risk. Previously he was a technical PM and software engineer at Funding Circle.

Edo worked as Investment associate and chief of staff at Rocket Internet early stage investment team and previously was Junior Associate at Boston Consulting Group.

OUR ASK:

If you are a fintech and are interested in exploring how Generative AI can streamline your risk and compliance controls‚Ä¶ get in touch at founders@godiligent.ai or find time to chat¬†here!

Two Dots - Income & Employment Verification for Lenders
See original launch post
THE PROBLEM

Traditionally when a consumer wants to borrow money, take out a mortgage, or rent an apartment, they need to provide the underwriter with a bunch of financial documents to prove they can afford the product.¬† This is a time consuming & fraud ridden process!

OUR SOLUTION

To solve this problem we‚Äôre first automating the process of verifying income and employment data for large property managers. Over time we plan to integrate with many data sources so payroll data can be seamlessly used to make better & faster underwriting decisions by any financial institution.

WHO WE ARE

I started my career working at Goldman for 4 years, before making the jump to startup-land as the 4th employee at a proptech startup, where we processed online rental applications.¬† Seeing up close how broken the income verification process is, and how broken the overall way underwriters decide who gets access to housing (credit scores), lead us to realize there‚Äôs a better way.

Max started his career as one of the first engineers on the income verification team at Blend, spending years working on this problem before making the jump to work on search at Google.¬† After experiencing both the excitement of being early at a rapidly scaling startup (Blend is now public), and the mega-scale of search at Google, Max and I decided we were the team to tackle the broken consumer underwriting system.

HOW YOU CAN HELP

Our biggest focus today is getting more customers, so if you know anyone managing thousands of rental properties we would love an intro!

Hear from the founders
How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)

Max and I have known each other since we were best friends at a middle school for gifted children in the Bay Area.After a four-year stint in the Foreign Exchange trading group covering Hedge Funds at Goldman, I spent two years as the fourth employee selling software to property managers. That experience taught me that every property manager‚Äôs biggest problem in their business was leasing, and no one had solved it. I called my old friend Max, who was working on the search team at Google, and asked him for advice on solving income verification for rentals. He responded that he had spent years working on this problem in the Mortgage space for Blend (now public), and that the transformers AI revolution finally made an end-to-end solution possible.Max resigned from Google a few months later, and we were working on Two Dots. Still hard to believe the serendipity sometimes.

Company Launches
Ocular AI - Bringing enterprise search, gen AI, and actions to the workplace
See original launch post

We‚Äôre Michael and Louis and are excited to officially launch Ocular AI!

Book demos here.

üí° Tl;Dr:

Ocular AI makes it easy for employees in mid-market and enterprise companies to find information and perform cross-tool actions using Generative AI-powered Search. We do this by providing a beautiful Google-like interface and a co-pilot that connects to all your company apps and tools.

‚ùå Problem

Having worked at Google and Microsoft, we experienced first-hand how difficult it is to access and find information and perform actions across multiple SaaS tools both in the workplace and in engineering. Through our experience and conversations with people at Appian, Boeing, General Electric, Uber, Pinecone, Brex, Coda, Unity, Microsoft, and Google, we learned that as companies grow it gets very challenging to:

Find what you need at work: Company knowledge lives in multiple, isolated SaaS applications, and employees spend over a quarter of their workday looking for information (think of documentation, past slack threads, etc), finding the people needed to complete tasks, and getting the required permissions.
Manage complex engineering tools: As engineering teams scale and adopt microservices, they onboard multiple tools for documentation, development, release, monitoring, and alerting. Critical data, metrics, logs, and dashboards are all in isolated platforms such as CircleCI, DataDog, and New Relic and this makes it very difficult to have a unified view of company data, correlation data across these tools, and complete multitool workflow coordination - especially during incidents.

Siloed tooling and data introduce an operational tax to the lives of employees like engineers, slowing down productivity, development cycles, and incident management. Workers spend an average of a quarter of their day searching for information.

All of this time can be used to write more code, do more deals, and talk to customers. With the rise of AI and Copilots, the value of the time spent on doing actual work has never been so high.

üöÄüöÄüöÄ Our Solution

üîé Enterprise Search for everyone in your company: Integrate all of your company‚Äôs applications, tooling, and data sources to power organizational and team-level search. Organization members only see the information they have access to based on their roles.


ü§ñ Ocular Copilot- your work assistant that knows everything about your company: Power cross-tool workflows and actions using our generative AI-powered Ocular Copilot. Create workspaces, upload files (structured or unstructured), create collections, and build usage-specific assistants for your day-to-day tasks.

App MarketPlace: Integrate the tools (Notion, Jira, Google Drive, Slack) you already love and use for your day-to-day tasks.

Admin Portal:

Ocular AI provides search-driven insights such as trending searches, number of searches, etc., which allows execs and managers to understand their organizations better. With Ocular, you can now see which applications are used the most and which ones are underutilized, allowing organizations to make reliable SaaS spend decisions.¬†In addition, add members, teams, and applications to your Ocular instance.

üìà Maximizing Generative AI ROI for Enterprise

Enterprises are eager to adopt Generative AI in the workplace to enhance operational efficiencies. We‚Äôre partnering with organizations to implement secure, compliant, and company-specific Generative AI.

üîê Enterprise security

Coming from Microsoft and Google, we understand the importance of data privacy and security. For that reason, you can self-host Ocular AI on-premise or on bring your own cloud (BYOC), so all your data stays within your control- we don‚Äôt have access to it. Ocular AI is also getting SOC2 compliant and enforcing end-to-end data encryption AES 256. We‚Äôll also be adding more security layers to ensure your data is 100% safe.

üíØ The Team

Dartmouth College graduates with software engineering experience building large-scale and compliant applications at Google and Microsoft.

ü´° Our Ask

Please introduce us to managers, CEOs, CIOs, and CTOs. We can help unify their tools and data together to make their teams more efficient.

Schedule a demo at www.useocular.com or here.

ü§ñ Cascading AI - Automate manual banking processes
See original launch post

Watch our launch video here.

tl;dr: Banks, credit unions, and fintechs spend billions to train and employ staff to handle complex systems and ever-growing service portfolios. Our AI agents make your teams 10x faster by navigating existing systems, surfacing the right information, and even communicating compliantly with your customers.

üèÜTHE TEAM

Lukas Haffer (CEO, Stanford GSB 23) spent the past 4 years deploying core banking systems and outsourcing banking processes as Chief of Staff for Europe at Avaloq (one of the world‚Äôs leading core banking system providers).

Isaiah Williams (CTO, Stanford CS 22) spent the past 4 years building conversational AI and production ML applications as a Senior ML engineer at EliseAI (one of the world‚Äôs leading conversational AI companies).

WHAT CAN AI DO FOR BANKING?

Lending & Onboarding: 300,000+ loan officers spend hours on the phone or e-mail getting applicants to complete their applications before they churn to competitors - our AI agent Leo does not give up until he has all the documents he needs.

Even if we pre-qualify more applicants, we don‚Äôt close more loans - because my loan officers can only have one conversation at a time.

Customer service: 30,000+ daily service requests present an insane challenge to the staff of a mid-sized bank, trying to navigate multiple outdated systems and product categories - our AI agent Tom navigates their systems, surfaces the right information, and drafts responses to your clients.

Customer support has become an insane job - my teams need to navigate 15 different systems just to help 1 customer.

Back-office: at one bank 50,000+ payments are halted every day for reasons as simple as a typo in the recipient account ID - our AI agent Anna analyzes unstructured financial information to recommend resolutions.

Even with 99% STP-rates (straight through processing) in payments, we have to manually handle thousands of exceptions.

‚ùå THE PROBLEM

Antiquated systems and manual exception handling slow down crucial banking processes, costing banks billions. Traditional robotic process automation (RPA) could not handle unstructured information. Traditional chatbots quickly reach their limits of usefulness. And custom ML applications take months (if not years) to develop from scratch.

‚úÖ OUR SOLUTION

Cascading AI agents integrate with the bank's existing IT infrastructure (in their private cloud or on-premise), learn to use their systems, and work with unstructured financial data to automate core processes.

HOW IT WORKS
Our Agents have eyes: we use computer vision to read documents & integrate with existing systems on a UI level in addition to your APIs
Our Agents can talk: we use conversational AI to communicate with customers or colleagues via SMS, E-Mail, Slack, Teams, secure messaging, or ticket management systems
Our Agents know banking: we monitor agents in human-in-the-loop systems and align them with banking regulation and compliance policies
OUR ASK
Connect us with Banks, Credit Unions, or Fintechs looking to automate manual processes and improve customer communication.
Book a demo or email us at lukas@cascading.ai
Follow Cascading AI on LinkedIn
Hear from the founders
What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

Banking IT is broken: 30 year old legacy systems, failing RPA projects and millions of people doing manual repetitive work. Over years in the industry, we saw how the financial industry was struggling to deal with mountains of unstructured data and failed to live up to customer expectations. Loan applicants have to go through humiliatingly slow application processes when they really needed someone to count on (no wonder look-to-book churn rates are at 65-80%) - the mania of manual workflows has to end\Money runs the world. Banks are critical and we need fresh talent to shake up a $25T industry.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

Unlocking $1T in value for global banks and making banking magical for billions of customers

Cedana - Real-time save, move and resume for compute
See original launch post

Hey, we‚Äôre Neel and Niranjan from Cedana.

THE PROBLEM

Losing work because of infra problems is painful. Imagine you have a long-running compute job and the instance fails. Your 20-hour job finished but because your pipeline was misconfigured you have to restart it from scratch.

Burning cash is stressful.¬† Poor utilization results in your inference jobs costing more.¬† If you‚Äôre managing a cluster of 1,000s of GPUs, poor utilization leaves money on the table even while demand is skyrocketing.

Cold start times impact your customer satisfaction and their reliance on your solution.

Limited GPU access makes it difficult for you to innovate, and finding GPUs can be a full-time job of constantly identifying, evaluating, and adapting different vendors.

OUR SOLUTION

Cedana is real-time migration for compute.¬† We automatically schedule and move workloads across instances and vendors without interrupting progress or breaking anything.

There are several critical benefits:

Utilization is maximized to save costs and eliminate idle resources.
Job-level SLAs dynamically allocate compute between inference and training, prioritizing costs, latency, and performance based on preferences.
Avoid re-running jobs from scratch due to infra, pipeline, or memory failures. Jobs continue their progress in the event of infra failure or spot revocation.
Access planet-scale compute through vendor aggregation
Solve the cold start problem by enabling fast auto-suspend-resume
Spot management that migrates and provisions new instances automatically upon revocation or failure.

OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Databricks employ some of these methods internally and we‚Äôre bringing them to everyone.

HOW IT WORKS

Cedana is available as an open-source package and as a managed service.

Cedana needs no code modification and works with Linux processes or containers
Current use cases and customers range from AI Training and Inference, High-Performance Compute, DevTools, ML Ops platforms, and Computational Biology.
It automatically provisions and manages infra with your existing credentials. Our managed service can leverage our vendor relationships if preferred.

Here‚Äôs a 1m30s demo video

OUR TEAM

Our team has built real-world robotics and large-scale computer vision systems across a number of places including 6 River Systems/Shopify and MIT.¬† We‚Äôve led the development, commercialization, and scale of NLP for clinical workflows used in the delivery of patient care. ¬† Our team‚Äôs publications span computer vision, computer graphics, robotics optimization, and spacecraft/aerospace controls, with patents in AI use cases for grid energy management, optimal battery control, and healthcare.

Meet Selene, a state-of-the-art LLM Judge trained specifically to evaluate AI responses. Selene is the best model on the market for evals, beating all frontier models from leading labs across 11 commonly used benchmarks for evaluators. Today, we are releasing:

API/SDK - Integrate Selene into your AI workflow
Alignment Platform - Build custom evaluation metrics for your use case

Get started using Selene for free.

Watch our demo here.

THE PROBLEM

Generative AI is unpredictable. Even the best models occasionally hallucinate, contradict themselves, or produce unsafe outputs. Many teams rely on the same general-purpose LLMs to evaluate AI outputs, but these models weren‚Äôt trained to be judges. That leads to:

Inaccurate evaluations and inefficient iteration cycles in development
Risky, unpredictable AI behavior in production
OUR SOLUTION

A SOTA model for evals: Selene outperforms all frontier models (OpenAI‚Äôs o-series, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek R1, etc.) across 11 benchmarks for scoring, classifying, and pairwise comparisons.

A platform to align our evaluator: Adapt Selene to your exact evaluation criteria‚Äîlike ‚Äúdetect medical advice,‚Äù ‚Äúflag legal errors,‚Äù or ‚Äújudge whether the agent upgraded its workflow correctly.‚Äù

Selene works seamlessly with popular frameworks like DeepEval (YC W25) and Langfuse (YC W23) ‚Äî just add it to your pipeline. And it runs faster than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

WHO WE ARE & WHY WE‚ÄôRE BUILDING THIS

We‚Äôre a small, highly technical team of AI researchers and engineers, with folks from leading AI labs and startups. Our mission is to enable the safe development of AGI. As models grow more powerful, we need a ‚Äòfrontier evaluator‚Äô that keeps pace with frontier AI. We see Selene as a stepping stone toward scalable oversight of powerful AI.

OUR ASK

Try Selene for free ‚Üí Integrate our API into your eval pipeline.

Try our Alignment Platform ‚Üí Craft a custom eval for your application.

Discord ‚Üí Leave feedback, get to know us, and brainstorm cool ideas.

Aqua Voice Desktop: Write clear, well-formatted text using only your voice.
See original launch post

Aqua Voice Desktop lets you create and edit clear, well-formatted text with your voice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFtMQdLwLGA

Hey, this is Finn from Aqua Voice. I‚Äôm excited to show you what we‚Äôre building.

This feels like upgrading voice dictation on my Mac¬†making it work how it should work.

The desktop experience is the best way to use Aqua yet. It lets you talk easily into any app and comes with:

- Fine-tuning: can have up to 800 custom words/phrases at a time, no pronunciation tuning required.

- Context Awareness: automatically identifies relevant words and phrases in the active application. This uses system accessibility APIs (not screenshots, like some others) and is heavily processed on device before inference to preserve privacy.

- Command recognition: the system now shows you what it's going to do before it does it. ""Deleting‚Ä¶"" or ""Adding to list‚Ä¶"" or ""Fixing Spelling‚Ä¶""

We've also spent a ton of time getting better out-of-the-box accuracy. Our core transcription engine is the most accurate real-time system that we know of. We scored 3.2% WER on Librispeech clean, significantly better than the next best real-time system we tested (Google) at 5.5%. We also released a benchmark that tests accuracy & human-friendly formatting which showed that out of the box, Wispr Flow makes 10x as many mistakes as Aqua Voice for emails and technical writing. The full write-up including audio and code is available here.

Everyone uses dictation for different reasons - I started in sixth grade (dyslexic) with Dragon Professional and always wanted it to be more than a clunky substitute for the keyboard. Hopefully Aqua Desktop can be that for some of you.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†Fluently: Use Zoom calls to improve your English
See original launch post

TL;DR: Fluently is an app that helps non-native professionals improve their English with instant feedback after each Zoom call. Imagine having a personal coach, always listening and providing tips.

See our demo!

PROBLEM ‚Äî GETTING FLUENT IN ENGLISH IS HARD
English level hits a plateau: Once you reach a certain level, it becomes difficult to progress further with traditional methods despite facing challenges in expressing yourself clearly and confidently.
Learning requires a lot of time and effort: Methods for language improvement require additional activities, that are time-consuming and do not fit into the busy schedules of non-native professionals.
A lack of feedback: Non-natives often feel nervous about their English level and mistakes. However, colleagues and even tutors fall short of providing targeted feedback that may help them improve.
SOLUTION ‚Äî GET ACTIONABLE FEEDBACK ON EVERY CALL

Learn on the go: Fluently runs in the background, analyzes your speech, and you receive instant feedback after each call. The app supports every meeting platform, with no bots joining your calls.

Personalized insights: Fluently offers a more efficient and convenient way to identify areas you need to improve by providing personalized feedback on your real-life speech.

Actionable feedback: Practice pronunciation, improve fluency, and grow your active vocabulary to boost your English skills.

WHO IS THIS FOR?
Non-native professionals¬†who want to achieve English fluency and communicate with clarity and confidence.
International companies who want to boost communication efficiency, get insights on English levels from real-life calls, and help employees improve.

Hear from the founders
How did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)

Back in the early 2010s, Mukul was hard at work helping Toyota determine how computers could use cameras to interpret and interact with the world. But Mukul had a problem - every day, he would go to get his lunch, and every day he‚Äôd spend most of that time (30-40 minutes) waiting in line in his corporate cafeteria. He decided to take a closer look at the issue and decided that computer vision could be the answer. After some initial testing, Mukul felt the idea was a big opportunity and flew to California to pitch his idea.There he reconnected with Abhinai, who was his classmate in the same dorm at IIT Delhi. He created an early demo that was so impressive that it convinced Abhinai to join him.Having worked in large companies and created some enormously successful projects, we were disheartened by the fact that when a project became successful, several people came in at the final stages to take credit. We decided to be founders and create a company that valued people‚Äôs contributions honestly and cut through the corporate bullshit.After successfully cold-calling head executives from some of the largest corporate cafeteria operators on the planet, we received many enthusiastic responses to our description of Mashgin‚Äôs Touchless Checkout System. He then set out to actually build it.After successfully building and demoing a Mashgin prototype to the YC team, Mashgin went from ‚Äúproject‚Äù to ‚Äúcompany‚Äù over the course of the Winter 15 Batch.

How did you decide to apply to Y Combinator? What was your experience applying, going through the batch, and fundraising at demo day?

We applied to YC very late, just a few days before the start of W15 batch. We were in the middle of raising a seed round and through our suboptimal interactions with investors, we realized that we needed YC guidance to help us raise a round on good terms. Our YC experience was amazing, if a bit overwhelming at times. YC partners forced us to think clearly about the next steps. At one point they had us go door to door to every business in Mountain View downtown to try and sell our product. We made our first sale that day and we‚Äôll never forget that experience! Fundraising post YC was every bit what we imagined it to be. It made the entire process super smooth and easy.

What's the history of your company from getting started until the present day? What were the big inflection points?

When we started the company in 2014, our initial goal was to improve the checkout experience in corporate dining facilities, cafeterias, and sports stadiums. We aimed to use computer vision and machine learning technology to create a much more efficient and convenient experience for customers.¬†Entering YC and getting to demo day with a major letter of intent was a big moment for the company, giving us the experience and fundraising to make Mashgin market-ready over the following few years.However, with the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the subsequent lockdowns, we had to pivot our focus to the convenience store space as corporate offices closed and retail demand for self-checkout solutions skyrocketed.During the pandemic we were able to secure an enormous deal with Circle K, one of the largest convenience store chains in the world, for 10,000 kiosks across their global portfolio of stores. This elevated us from a burgeoning player in AI to the most market-tested solution in the world.In May 2022, we were able to announce a Series B funding round of $62.5 million with a valuation of $1.5 billion, earning us the title of ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù company. The round was led by NEA, a global venture capital firm that‚Äôs invested in other successful startups like Cloudflare, Patreon Plaid, and Robinhood, with additional support from our existing investor, Matrix Partners.Today Mashgin continues to expand within the convenience, sports, and corporate dining industries while beginning to explore adjacent opportunities in spaces like ski resorts, quick service restaurants, and drug stores.

What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

Online retail has gone through several iterations in the past few decades and the experience today is extremely frictionless. Physical retail on the other hand has not seen the same level of innovation and the experience hasn‚Äôt changed much since the early 90s. We want to use the latest advances in AI and Computer Vision to make physical retail as easy and frictionless as online retail.More specifically, Mashgin solves the problem of long wait times and checkout bottlenecks. Customers often experience frustration and dissatisfaction when they have to wait in long lines to check out, and retailers also face the challenge of managing and staffing checkouts.¬†This is a big problem because lines are a waste of time for everyone involved. Over the course of a lifetime, the average person will spend years waiting in lines. And those lines aren‚Äôt just wasted time for consumers, they result in lost sales for retailers. Studies by Forrester and BlueDot have shown that retailers lose as much as 57% of their sales when customers perceive the line as long (which in a convenience store is 3 people).Besides being frustrated by our own lunch lines, we decided to work on this problem because we saw an opportunity to use computer vision and machine learning to create a more efficient and convenient shopping experience for customers across industries.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

At Mashgin, our long-term vision is to create a world where the shopping experience is completely seamless and frictionless. If we succeed, waiting in line to purchase goods will be a thing of the past. Consumers will have more time to do the things that they love with a faster, more convenient, and less stressful experience in retail and dining spaces.¬† For retailers and concessionaires the technology will free up time and resources, allowing them to focus staff on other key areas of the business like stocking, cooking, cleaning, and customer service.

üöÄ Veles - Your copilot for enterprise sales
See original launch post

TL;DR: Veles is your copilot for enterprise sales - equip your sales team with an AI-powered quoting tool. Integrated seamlessly with your CRM, CPQ, and BI platforms - give reps a tool they will actually love, and leadership the actionable insights they need to move the needle.

*************

ü§Ø The Problem

Pricing enterprise sales deals is a headache. Fragmented processes and tools result in subpar terms and lost opportunities. Many teams resort to complex Google Sheets, Slides/PPTs, manual CRM entries, and email chains just to handle pricing.

‚ùå Missed Quota: On average 60% of sales reps hit quota due to fragmented tooling, inconsistent processes, and lack of transparency.

‚ùå Slow Ramp: Onboarding new sales reps takes 5 - 7 months due to poorly documented pricing strategies and variations across companies.

‚ùå Little Collaboration: Leadership lacks scalable insight into sales negotiations, hindering optimization and guidance for sales reps.

‚ùå No Knowledge Share: Top performers' insights are trapped, preventing learning and team-wide improvement.

‚ö°Ô∏è The Solution

Introducing Veles - the enterprise sales co-pilot, designed to enhance negotiation skills, minimize discounting, and land larger deals with confidence. Veles offers an easy-to-use calculator, benchmarks for comparing deals against those of peers, and clear guidance on deal desk rules, ensuring accurate pricing and standard terms.

Streamline collaboration with management and equip sales reps with the necessary insights to navigate the quoting and negotiation process effectively, eliminating the reliance on outdated methods (like Google Sheets) and driving sales success through informed decision-making.

Key Features:

‚úÖ SaaS Pricing Calculator: Easily standardize pricing and track sales rep behavior in one intuitive platform.

‚úÖ Standard Deal Definition: Define sales strategies and terms to expedite onboarding and maintain negotiation consistency.

‚úÖ Performance Analytics: Gain insights into sales rep behaviors that lead to closed-won deals through comprehensive deal scoring.

‚úÖ Alignment & Optimization: Foster team alignment by sharing negotiations and strategies for successful negotiation calls.

Hear from the founders
What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

The core idea behind Roboflow is that engineers need tools to build and deploy custom computer vision solutions to production. Each computer vision use case is unique, team competencies vary, and level of customization required is different. While there are many independent variables, all computer vision solutions have a common pipeline: collect data, manage data, label data, process data, train a model, deploy the model, and display results.¬†Roboflow provides tools for each step in that process and integrates with your existing solutions so you can tailor your pipeline to meet your needs. We take an extensible and interoperable approach to tools which lets you do things like easily implement a new open source framework, programming language, or technology into your pipeline, whenever you need it. No software or hardware lock-in, just infrastructure, building blocks, and tools to increase productivity.With a few images, you can train a working computer vision model in an afternoon. For example, bring data into Roboflow from anywhere via API, label images with our cloud-hosted image annotation tool, kickoff a hosted model training (or export to your favorite cloud GPU), and deploy the model via a hosted API endpoint. This process can be executed in a code-centric way, in the UI, or any mix of the two.

askLio - AI-Copilot for procurement teams
See original launch post

**TL;DR;**
At askLio, we use AI to help procurement teams automate free-text requests and guide employees. When an employee at a large enterprise wants to buy something, the procurement process used to take weeks - our AI turns it into hours.

If you're a procurement leader, connect with us today.

From left to right Till, Lukas and Vladi

‚ùå The Problem

Employees at large enterprises have a hard time understanding and following all the procurement rules when they want to buy products or services. This leads to thousands of requests from employees to the procurement team asking to get what they are looking for.

Since many of these requests are coming in as plain text, it was impossible to process them automatically. With the current ways of handling these free-text requests, procurement has been doomed to process every single one manually.

Procurement teams spend hours of manual work to

understand the requirements of the employee
directing spend appropriately to existing contracts, vendors, and catalogs where possible
identifying and fixing incorrect or missing information
trying to conduct spend analysis which is nearly impossible for text requests

This finally turns procurement into a costly and week-long process.

üí° The solution

With Generative AI, we enter an era where technology can support procurement teams processing these text requests.

In an ideal world, software would automate all the steps: Employees could state their request in natural language, specify their demand and immediately see in which catalog they can find the solution or with what vendors existing contracts are already in place.

Our software does precisely that.


Sitting in MS Teams or the P2P-System: our AI-Copilot reduces cost by freeing up procurement teams from time-hungry tasks by automatically processing free-text requests.

The AI tackles them and assists in refining specifications, taking full advantage of existing contracts and structuring purchase requirements - enriching them with e.g. purchase category.
Since our AI understands text requests, it enables procurement to do spend analysis and category management within seconds.

Schedule a demo here to see how Lio‚Äôs technology can help your team scale procurement without scaling headcount.

üåü Our mission
After experiencing the procurement pain firsthand (working at big enterprises like SAP, waiting months to get the things we need) and consulting big firms on procurement - we set our mission on leading the initiative with our AI solution.
We are addressing the operational excellence need, talent shortage, and effective demand management.¬†Making the greatest impact on cost and risk throughout the whole procurement process.

What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

Doctors spend 50% of their time on things other than patient care, and the other 50% is inefficient.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

Our long term vision is to build the best fully autonomous AI Doctor. Closing the gap in care costs and who‚Äôs able to have access to care. We believe access to care is a basic human right.

We knew we needed to send sales emails, post regularly on social media, keep an eye on Google Ads, or simply manage the endless flood of emails‚Äîbut somehow, these tasks always slipped through the cracks. The intention was there, but reality always got in the way.

That's why we created Marblism: AI Employees who seamlessly handle the tasks you keep putting off. No complex setups or prompts needed‚Äîjust tell them about your business once and let them work quietly in the background. Suddenly, those tasks you knew you should be doing actually get done, giving you more time and mental clarity to focus on what truly matters.

Talc: Debugger for your LLMs
See original launch post

TL;DR:

We make it easy to debug and test LLM systems. Understand your AI by replaying sessions line by line and setting rules for it to follow moving forward.

Hey Everyone! We‚Äôre Matt & Max, the team behind Talc.AI

Matt: I‚Äôve spent the last 6 years engineering at Facebook and Airbnb. At FB I worked on Election Integrity, developing new ways to detect foreign interference campaigns. Hit me up if you want to hear some war stories!

Max: I found my passion for tech early, teaching myself to code when I was 13. This journey most recently brought me to being the technical lead for a 30 person org at Facebook that reviewed every major product launch. I love the challenge of trying to understand complex systems and want to help people do the same with Talc.

We‚Äôve been friends for almost a decade and couldn‚Äôt be more excited to be doing this together.

THE PROBLEM

Developing real LLM systems is still hard. Prompt engineering is full of trial and error, and debugging your chain and regression testing is a painful manual process.

THE SOLUTION

Replay any session your AI has had and tweak it until it's perfect. No more copy and pasting into a playground ‚Äì re-run your sessions exactly as they happened and deeply understand their possible outputs. Have a bug on message 20? Hop into that context immediately and start fixing it.

Left: Walk through your AI message logs

Right: Edit the inputs and prompts that went into each message, all auto-populated for you

Test changes against your saved use cases for regression testing

What we‚Äôre asking

Is LLM debugging & testing holding you back? Reach out to us at talc.ai or book time directly on our calendars!
Do you know anyone working on LLMs in production? We‚Äôd love to learn from them! Help us get connected.
Share us with anyone who spends a lot of time debugging LLMs
Blurb: Talc.ai launched an LLM debugger so you don‚Äôt have to copy context into openai playground or jupyter notebooks any more. Reach out via founders@talc.ai.

OWNY - AI-centric capital and banking solutions
See original launch post

We‚Äôre Umed and Ola from Owny and we just launched a product revamp for startups to manage capital and banking needs. We use AI for bank account creation, quick transactions, simplified onboarding and verification processes, and user-friendly management tools.
‚Äî

THE PROBLEM

Startups and PE/VC funds have to rely on multiple systems, PDF files, and manual processes to raise capital, manage investors, and handle payments. Bank accounts can take weeks if not months to create. These disconnected and inefficient methods are slow, costly, and prone to errors. In addition, the existing tools and technology used in this process were often manual and didn't seamlessly integrate across different systems.

OUR SOLUTION

OWNY is a platform that leverages AI tools and the latest technology to facilitate efficient capital management and payment flow. It offers quick transactions, simplified onboarding and verification processes, and user-friendly management tools to address challenges in the startup and private equity sectors. By utilizing AI and standardization, OWNY aims to streamline processes and enhance overall functionality.

Accounts typically get approved on the same day.

Companies can benefit by using OWNY‚Äôs ready to use & free tools to manage:

Raising SAFE capital - use ready-to-go YC SAFE templates to collect signatures and payments in minutes.
Foreign currency needs - OWNY enables you to hold balances in USD and 30 other major currencies.
FX payments - send and receive payments from anywhere in the world. We negotiated very hard to give our users the best FX rates. Let us know if you find a better FX rate and we will match it.
Treasury & Yield - simply click to transfer your cash to start earning up to 5.5% APY with the US-based systematically important banks. No lockups. $1 minimum. FDIC insured up to $175M.
PE/VC funds - launch a fund using our free standard templates or bring your own fund documents. Do it yourself for free.
Manage investors - send updates, run capital calls, and make distributions for any fund type. Free.

Want to give it a shot? Try it here: https://www.owny.com/signup

WHO WE ARE

Umed Latifov & Ola Wiberg have many years of experience in banking and technology. Notably, Ola was co-founder of Human API, which was recently acquired for 9+ figures. Umed has spent years in PE/VC investing and was Central Bank Governor for a country.

Magic Hour - Create engaging videos using AI
See original launch post

Hi everyone! We're Runbo and David, and we‚Äôre building Magic Hour, a video creation platform that makes it easy for anyone to create professional-quality videos.

Imagine swapping your face onto Anne Hathaway‚Äôs in The Devil Wears Prada, or transforming Michael Jordan into a marble statue shooting a game-winner in the Colosseum.

Try Our Website: magichour.ai

The Problem

Many creators, professionals, and businesses struggle to produce enough engaging, high-quality videos due lack of video production expertise and constraints on time and budget.

The Solution

We take the best open-source AI models, figure out the best settings, and put them in a user-friendly UX so anyone can create high-quality videos in three easy steps: choose a template, customize it, and share it.

About Us

Our moms are best friends and introduced us in 1997 (left). Magic Hour is born out of experiences helping our parents market their small businesses, where we learned how hard it is to create engaging video content.

Give us feedback at founders@magichour.ai
If you have any connections to businesses that make a lot of video content, especially professional sports teams, we‚Äôd love to connect

üìà Revamp: Smarter customer segmentation for eCommerce
See original launch post
‚è≥ TL;DR:

Revamp helps eCommerce brands and agencies understand customer behavior by creating smarter segments for targeted email and paid acquisition campaigns.

üò£ What‚Äôs the problem?

Email marketers and paid media buyers struggle to understand customer behavior because:

eCommerce data is fragmented across many platforms
Most brands and agencies are non-technical and struggle to stitch data together
Even if they stitch the data, analyzing it and acting on it is a struggle

As a result, email marketers default to generic customer segments and media buyers resort to using the bare minimum in their acquisition campaigns.

This translates to millions of unpersonalized emails sent every day and millions of dollars in wasted ad spend on mediocre customer segments.

üëï Why are we solving this?

We‚Äôre Amin Akhtar and Stephen Campbell. We‚Äôve been friends for years and will be co-founders for many more to come!

Let me (Amin) tell you the story of how we got here üôÇ

As Chief Revenue Officer of a bootstrapped D2C brand, I found myself spending time I didn‚Äôt have wrangling customer data across an ever-expanding tech stack.

As a result, I, like most D2C marketers, resorted to using basic customer segments like ‚Äúpurchased in the last 30 days‚Äù in campaigns ‚Äì that too without really knowing anything about their behavior besides the obvious.¬†

The outcome? Declining revenue from over email and dropping conversion across paid acquisition campaigns that kept me up at night.

To solve my problem I built a prototype (read: series of massive spreadsheets) to create better segments which drove a near-instant 5% increase in revenue from email campaigns + improved performance on the acquisition side.

After hearing my pain points for (at least) the hundredth time, Stephen decided to partner up with me and we got to building. Now we‚Äôre actively realizing our vision of a better future for eCommerce retention.

üîé How are we solving it?

Revamp intelligently stitches data across Klaviyo and Shopify, automatically creates valuable customer segments and calculates metrics and insights specific to that segment.

We then give users the ability to flexibly analyze data and observe differences in behavior in seconds - a task that would‚Äôve taken them days if not weeks to do without it!

Finally, users can push our segments to Klaviyo with one click and Revamp does the heavy lifting of making sure everything‚Äôs synced up!

üôè How can you help us?

Drop us a follow on LinkedIn and follow our journey!
We‚Äôd greatly appreciate any intros to D2C brands, eCommerce agencies or anyone looking to improve their email marketing!

Company Launches
Slack Huddles API by Recall.ai
See original launch post

Hey everyone!

We just launched an API that lets developers programmatically access Slack Huddles data, making it possible to build apps that capture, analyze, and integrate Slack Huddles conversations.

Why we built this

Slack Huddles are great for quick discussions, but they don‚Äôt provide a way to retrieve transcripts, recordings, or speaker data. Once a huddle ends, the conversation is gone.

What developers can build with the Slack Huddle API

With a single API call, you can:

Retrieve transcripts, recordings, and speaker timelines from Slack Huddles
Automate workflows for incident management, support escalations, and team handoffs
Integrate Slack Huddles data into CRMs, analytics platforms, and knowledge bases
Build AI-powered tools for summarization, insights, or search on top of huddle data

Get access

Check out the Slack Huddles API documentation and get started here.

Subsets ‚Äì The AI retention co-pilot for subscription businesses
See original launch post

‚åõÔ∏è TL;DR: Subsets makes it simple to understand, engage, and retain subscribers by enabling personalized and proven retention initiatives based on AI. Our solution helps leading subscription businesses increase CLV by +20% and extend subscriber lifetime up to 6 months.

Hi everyone! We are Oliver, Martin, Matias, and Nikolai - the co-founders of Subsets.

from left to right.

Oliver leads machine learning and AI development; graduate in machine learning, previously worked as an ML engineer.

Martin heads the company; graduate in machine Learning, worked in management consulting for two years helping companies scale AI applications.

Matias carries engineering at Subsets; CS graduate, software engineer in both venture scale-up and big tech (Amazon and Microsoft).

Nikolai drives growth and operations; experience with growth (ABM & marketing automation) and revenue operations at a fast growing SaaS scale-up.

ü´† The Problem

Healthy consumer subscription businesses lose 20-40% of their subscribers annually
Think about a subscription you have personally - subscribers are flooded with impersonal and irrelevant information which does not encourage active engagement
CRM teams do not have solutions available to figure out what the subscriber needs right now to make the most out of their subscription
Current AI retention solutions are built for engineers, not commercial people

üí° The Solution

Subsets is The AI retention co-pilot for subscription businesses

We enable CRM teams to understand, engage, and retain subscribers by enabling personalized and proven retention initiatives based on AI. Initiatives that work get automated and run continuously on dynamic subscriber audiences. By knowing what initiatives work across different subscription businesses, Subsets can recommend initiatives that give ROI fast.

Understand, engage, retain by learning from experimentation

Our solution helps leading subscription businesses increase CLV by +20% and extend subscriber lifetime up to 6 months.

üôå Our Ask: Intros to consumer subscription businesses

Users: If you know anyone who works in consumer-focused subscription businesses, we would like to talk to them and share what we are building! You can introduce us at martin.johnsen@subsets.ai
Pilots: If you are interested in using Subsets, feel free to sign up on www.subsets.com or reach out directly to the founders at founders@subsets.com

Anarchy üß™ - LLM infrastructure for building conversational applications üèóÔ∏è
See original launch post

Greetings YC community! We‚Äôre Matt and James, the founders of Anarchy. We‚Äôve been working in AI for a long time (Matt just finished a PhD working on formal methods in deep learning) and have become experts in taming LLMs. We started Anarchy to share these advances with devs who want to use LLMs in production.

PROBLEM

While LLMs are beginning to be used as universal text interfaces, developers and prompt engineers are beginning to want consistent and reliable LLMs with agency: LLMs which can search through their ever-changing databases, be able to book meetings, and generally make calls to their APIs. However, coaxing LLMs to behave consistently is black magic requiring constant vigilance, and relying on a single provider can be a risky point of failure.

SOLUTION

Our platform abstracts away the unpredictable work of researching ideal prompts so developers can focus on building business logic: Provide your API and its description, and your LLM-keys, and anarchy will provide you an LLM endpoint (or web-interface chatbot) that can answer questions and solve problems using your API and load-balance between LLMs.

Here's a short product demo

ASK

If this excites you (or anybody you might know, YC or not) and you‚Äôd like to try our product, please contact us by signing up.

If you want to have a chat about LLM tech or ask us questions directly, feel free to join our discord: https://discord.gg/qaFf7S373c

We‚Äôre also in the process of building up our twitter and linkedin and would appreciate a follow üôÇ!

Hear from the founders
What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?

Developers need an easy way to collaborate on the step-by-step process of gathering data and training AI models.Out of the box, LLMs can be >100b parameters and require trillion token datasets. This is more than most organizations are equipped to handle: a few years ago, few had heard of LLMs, and now organizations are scrambling to get ahold of GPUs to train and run them. The famous models are furthermore proprietary. Privacy, quality and efficiency needs are leading organizations to train their own models. \While training these models, developers are constantly adjusting their datasets. As their projects grow, it becomes harder to keep track of the changes, and figure out what data and models to use and track these things in production.

What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?

We want so solve every problem. We believe mobilizing every developer to work together to building their own AIs is key to this. If you have a unique form of cancer you should be able to spin up your own AI purpose built to solving it, forked from cancer-research-bot.

‚≠êÔ∏è Evefan ‚Äî Self-hosted Segment alternative ‚Äî 99% savings w/ Cloudflare Workers (OSS)
See original launch post

TLDR; Evefan enables developers to privately capture, transform, and deliver customer events at internet scale. Evefan is open source and self-hosted on Cloudflare workers. It can be configured either via our Evefan Console or via Wrangler. With Evefan, organizations can save > 99% when scaling events.

Need help scaling events? Let‚Äôs talk! https://cal.com/amadeo-evefan

‚ùå PROBLEM: SCALING CUSTOMER EVENTS IS HARD

Before joining YC, I led a large portion of the Blockchain.com consumer product. At the time, we had the most popular crypto wallet with over 60M accounts. We only made money on a subset of users who used our ‚Äòpremium‚Äô features.

As a result, we could not afford to understand how free users used our product. We got seven-figure quotes (üò±) from the top vendors in the Customer Data Platform (CDP) space and tried to self-host several alternatives. Imagine a PM team considering whether adding an event is worth XXXX dollars. Silly.

All the products we self-hosted then fell over at our scale. We had to build our own, more narrow version for our use case. There‚Äôs a reason for it‚Äîyou could even say that it‚Äôs a dark industry secret.

üò≠ Self-Hosting Is Meant To Be Practical

Existing OSS alternatives in the market are all built with massive multitenancy in mind. They‚Äôre not meant to be practically self-hosted. Most of them tell you in their docs to only self-host for toy projects or require overly expensive closed source ‚Äòhigh availability‚Äô add-ons that they can only configure for them to work correctly. That‚Äôs OK; they serve a different use case.

Look at the architecture of the top self-hostable alternatives in the space. Imagine asking your SRE team to ‚Äòsimply‚Äô set these up and keep them highly available (even with Docker & Kubernetes, it's not core work).

‚≠êÔ∏è THE SOLUTION: EVEFAN
Segment compatible: this means you can use the battle-tested Segment SDKs in your preferred programming language.
Deploy to Cloudflare: Configure Evefan instance via our console with your Cloudflare API key or yourself via Wrangler. Evefan will create a bundle with just your destinations small enough to run on Cloudflare.
Transform and Deliver To Your Destinations: We‚Äôve made Bigquery and Postgres work so far. We also added Mixpanel just for fun. We‚Äôve reviewed the top data warehouses and are confident we will natively support them.

Over time, Evefan will become an indispensable part of your async events delivery infrastructure. Use cases like in-and-out webhooks, queues, pub-sub, and jobs are coming!

üòª It‚Äôs 99% Cheaper Than Alternatives & Built For Scale

Here‚Äôs why: We follow a Bring Your Own Compute (BYOC) model. When Evefan runs in your infra, it roughly incurs $70 of Cloudflare worker compute for every 100 million events processed. This is 99.5% cheaper than Segment and similar alternatives! Of course, price is not the only reason people self-host. In Finance and Healthcare, for example, it is often the only practical option.

Ponder: Voice AI Infrastructure for Web Applications
See original launch post

tl;dr

Ponder lets developers add an ultra-realistic Voice AI agent to the bottom right corner of their websites in one line of code.

It can interact with your UI, call functions, access APIs, navigate, basically anything that can be wrapped in a JS function.

Users can talk to it like with a human, for use cases such as faster onboarding, customer support, bookings, data entry, or having a hands-free UX.

You can also build your own UI for the voice agent using our React SDK

The Problem

Voice AI models are having a moment currently, and the ability to simply talk like with a friend has opened up a higher bandwidth way of communicating with software, especially with the rise of prompt-based and conversational workflows, where it fits perfectly.

But if you have to add a voice agent to your website, you have to build your own stack dealing with the async hell of parallel websockets + streaming model calls, voice activity detection, background noise suppression, speaker diarization, TTS, STT, integrating with language models, streaming function calls AND somehow keep the latency to ~400-700 ms

Similar services have made notable advances, but their stack still remains heavily optimized for telephony.

Web app-specific cases, such as handling UI state updates asynchronously, waiting for user action, controlling responses based on function calls, interruption handling (user takes action midway when AI is talking) - while maintaining a fluid & human-like conversational flow remains a challenge

Solution: Meet Ponder

Using Ponder‚Äôs React SDK - you can add a voice agent to the bottom right corner of the screen. All you have to do is wrap your _app.js component in PonderProvider

Just with this, you will have the Ponder widget render on your website that users can talk to.

After that, you dynamically control the context and actions the agent can take on each page by using the setActions and setInstructions hooks, anywhere in your app.

Actions can have JavaScript functions that are already part of your code base. Simply pass them to¬†setActions¬†along with a description for the agent. (checkout docs for more details)

You can configure the agent on Ponder‚Äôs dashboard, choose a Voice, LLM, and the system prompt. If you want to attach external docs to the context, simply add curly braces variables in the system prompt, and for each variable, pick a data source (currently supports Confluence and Google Docs)

Ponder supports both Voice and Text modes. The messages get populated in the Ponder widget as the conversation unfolds:

Who needs Ponder?

Companies that offer prompt-based conversational apps -¬†e.g., Creativity tools, text-to-anything, agentic workflows - where the user needs to craft a prompt. Making it conversational lets the user brainstorm the prompt with the agent - ‚ÄúI want it to look more like a‚Ä¶..‚Äú
Companies that have a data entry part to their apps - For example we are working with an inspections software provider to make construction inspection officials enter large amounts of data into the software simply by speaking- making it much faster - ‚ÄúThe inspection ID is 1234 and the beam is 30 by 30 by 52 inches‚Äú
Companies that are struggling with onboarding - especially for applications whose users are not the most tech savvy, and despite your best efforts at building an intuitive UI, struggle to operate it. With Ponder, users can simply talk with your application.
In-App assistance, customer support, scheduling, and other usual suspects

If this sounds interesting, reach out to me at sarang@useponder.ai or try out Ponder today at useponder.ai üöÄ

Campfire - The modern version of NetSuite
See original launch post

tl;dr: Campfire is an accounting platform for startups and mid-size tech companies that are outgrowing QuickBooks or Xero, or are frustrated with NetSuite or Sage. It‚Äôs a modern general ledger with advanced features such as multi-entity support and advanced revenue reporting in a modern, consumer-grade interface.

Revenue dashboard

We‚Äôve been building our accounting platform to compete with Netsuite since day one at Campfire, but it‚Äôs a massive undertaking, so our initial product launch was one of our features - Revenue Automation for unified invoicing/payments, revenue accounting, and reporting. And today, I‚Äôm thrilled to share more about our flagship product - Core Accounting. It‚Äôs a modern accounting platform with companies such as Carbon Direct, Populi, and Delphia using the product. We‚Äôve been beta testing our general ledger since July with customers that range in size from 10 employees to 150-employee global companies and are now ready to onboard more customers. Our typical customer migrates to Campfire from QuickBooks and Xero, but we‚Äôve also migrated customers from mid-market ERPs like Sage Intacct and NetSuite.

Multi-entity income statement:

My co-founder, Fernando, and I (John) have scaled multiple accounting software companies including Invoice2go (acquired by Bill.com for $600M+) and Trovata (powering the treasury accounting for companies like Block and Etsy).

Campfire benefits

Turn the lights on for your financial data¬†- Unlock actionable and timely KPIs and financial insights with advanced financial reporting for increased visibility such as contribution margin by customer and P&L by department. Empowering executives to make informed, timely decisions.
Scale from startup to global operations¬†- The first modern general ledger that effortlessly scales globally with your company via support for muti-entity and multi-currency financial consolidation, advanced revenue automation, and multi-dimensional reporting.
Accelerate the accounting close process¬†- In the current environment, we‚Äôre all looking to grow faster while cutting burn. Streamline accounting and financial reporting workflows to free up resources so your team can focus on strategic, high-value work.
API-first approach¬†- Our¬†modern APIs¬†power custom integrations for customers that have automated custom accounting workflows in a matter of days.

Quotes from a few customers:

‚ÄúWe migrated from Sage Intacct to Campfire to accelerate our close process. It‚Äôs the only solution in the market that is modern, yet has the power to support our global operations across multiple legal entities and currencies.‚Äù

Andrea Burton, CPA | VP of Finance Delphia (YC W18)

‚ÄúWhen we were on QuickBooks, it was obvious the product was not built for tech companies like ours. The migration to Campfire was painless and now we are able to make informed decisions and track KPIs as we scale.‚Äù

Jon Yoo, CEO @ Suger (YC W23)

SiLogy: Chip design and verification in the cloud
See original launch post

TL;DR: SiLogy is building a platform for chip developers to run tests, track test statistics, and collaborate on debugging.

‚Äî

Hey, we‚Äôre Paul and Kay, the cofounders of SiLogy. We‚Äôre building chip design and verification tools to speed up the semiconductor development cycle.

The Problem

Interest in designing new chips is growing, thanks to demand from AI and the predicted decline of Moore‚Äôs Law. Since the number of possible states grows exponentially with chip complexity, the need for testing in simulation is exploding, with chip developers already spending 70% of their time on testing. (See this video on the verification gap).

Tooling hasn‚Äôt kept up. The state-of-the-art in collaborative debugging is to walk to a coworker‚Äôs desk and point to an error in a log file or waveform file. Each chip company rolls out its own tooling and infra to deal with this‚Äîthis was Kay‚Äôs entire job at his last gig. But they want to work on chips, not devtools! The solutions they come up with are often inadequate and frustrating. That‚Äôs why we started SiLogy.

The solution

SiLogy is a web app to manage the entire digital verification workflow. (‚ÄúDigital verification‚Äù means testing the logic of the design and includes everything before the physical design of the chip. It‚Äôs the most time-consuming stage in verification.)

We combine three capabilities:

Test running, results, and statistics: Our CI tool runs tests in the cloud, allowing engineering teams unlimited flexibility in scaling their test volume. We also track each project‚Äôs progress in test coverage and test pass rate.

Killer application-specific features: We‚Äôre building features tailored for verification use cases. We incorporate a test orchestration framework, waveform viewer, coverage report, and other features specifically for verification teams, providing customers an advantage over competitors using a generic CI solution such as Jenkins.

Collaboration: soon you‚Äôll be able to send a link to and leave a comment on a specific location within a log or waveform file, just like in Google Docs.

Asks

If you have experience with Verilog, even just from college, give our product a try at https://dash.silogy.io/signup. Tell your loved ones who work on chip or FPGA design and verification to give us a try as well.

If you have thoughts on the state of verification, get in touch at paul@silogy.io. If you or someone you know wants a demo, schedule a meeting with us here.

Thanks for your support!

üé• QuickVid Autopilot - Post 1 viral clip per day to your socials
See original launch post

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm Dan, and I‚Äôm super excited to share that we are starting to roll out QuickVid Autopilot!

THE PROBLEM

Consistently posting clips to your socials is just too time-consuming and expensive.

üïó Time Intensive: Curating and editing a 40-second clip from a 30-minute video can take up to 1-2 hours.

üí∞ Expensive: A decent video editor can cost upwards of $200/clip

üñ•Ô∏è Difficult to get started: Editing requires specialized software like Adobe Premiere

üò∞ You are too busy: Consistently posting to your socials is something that busy founders just don‚Äôt have time for!

üìä Trends are always changing: What works on each social channel is always changing. We stay on top of trends, so you don‚Äôt have to.

THE SOLUTION

Connect Autopilot to your long videos and desired posting locations, and you‚Äôre done! Autopilot will find the best clip from all your video sources and post it on your behalf every day.

Connect your video source

These are the locations QuickVid will pull clips from. QuickVid checks for new content daily. (YouTube, Drive, Zoom, etc.)

Connect your video destinations

This is where Autopilot will post your clips every day (YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc)

Choose your cadence

Either post once per day or let our AI decide the best time and cadence to post

ABOUT THE CLIPS

Clips are:

Automatically cropped to a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
Auto-Reframed to focus on the speaker
Baked with captions to help keep a viewer‚Äôs attention
Personalized with your branding

WHO IS AUTOPILOT FOR?

If you consistently create long talking videos (podcasts, interviews, zoom meetings, etc.) and are struggling to keep up with posting clips, sign up for Autopilot, and I will personally onboard you!

Most observability tools stop at logs. Tropir doesn‚Äôt just show you what broke‚Äîit tells you why, applies a fix, reruns the whole pipeline, and checks if the problem‚Äôs actually solved.

You can say: ‚ÄúFigure out why the @last_log wasn‚Äôt grounded in retrieved context. Use @faithfulness_eval.‚Äù Or just: ‚ÄúThis output sucks. Use the full eval set to fix it.‚Äù

Tropir handles the rest.

üß† Why Tropir is Different
Traceback Engine ‚Äî Finds the root cause across prompts, retrievals, tools, and context.
Fix + Rerun ‚Äî Smart patches injected on the fly. No code rewrites.
Built-in Evals ‚Äî Relevance, grounding, structure‚Äîall tested automatically. Add your own evals if you like!
Conversational Interface ‚Äî It‚Äôs like interrogating your agent after runtime.
Plug & Play ‚Äî Two lines of code to setup Tropir and you‚Äôre done.
üî• Try Tropir

Teams building RAG workflows, support bots, and research agents are shipping AI 60x faster with Tropir.

Giga ML's X1 Large 32k - The most powerful on-prem deployable model
See original launch post

We are announcing our first lineup of on-premise LLMs, X1 Large 8k, 32k ‚Äî pre-trained and fine-tuned versions of llama2 70B, which are outperforming Claude 2 on the MT bench with a score of 8.1 vs 8. (White paper coming soon with performance on all the benchmarks.)

X1 Large is available for further fine-tuning and pre-training. Try it out here and let us know what you think!

The problems today:

Pre-training: Existing large language models (LLMs) lack the ability to pre-train on specific text data, hindering their effectiveness in specialized domains like healthcare, legal, and finance.
Fine-tuning: The inability to fine-tune LLMs for specific output structures or forms restricts their adaptability in critical areas requiring tailored responses.
Privacy: Organizations dealing with sensitive customer data face trust & compliance challenges when using third-party servers like OpenAI and Anthropic.

X1 Large:

Performance: Achieves an MT bench score of 8.1, surpassing Claude 2 after fine-tuning and pre-training.
Customization: Our unique pre-training and fine-tuning capabilities provide unrivaled performance for industry-specific use cases.
Security: Offers secure on-premise deployment, ensuring data privacy for enterprises.
State of the art RAG: We‚Äôre partnering with @Mano AI to bring state of art RAG for on-prem deployment on your petabytes of data.

Our ask:

Try out out the demo here with your prompt and let us know how it performed! Email us at founders@gigaml.com if you want fine-tuning and pre-training access in-cloud or on-premise.

Coming soon:

X1 Large Med: Continuing pre training on Medical data.

X1 Large Law: Continuing pre training on entire law data base of all the countries.
